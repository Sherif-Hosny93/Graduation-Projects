Cairo,2023,Dr. Hassan Mostafa,NA,Digital,Master Information Block Decoding for 5G NR technology,"The PBCH Decoding processor is a purely digital processor that is customized to decode the PBCH channel within the NR modem. Form the overall system perspective and the microprocessor point-of-view, this processor is employed as a HW accelerator that receives a command from the microprocessor through its register interface. The command is mainly to decode the PBCH channel. However, this command should be associated with various system parameters (such as the cell ID, the time stamp, etc.) that enables the PBCH Decoding processor to decode the PBCH. In return, the PBCH Decoding processor would inform the microprocessor that the processing is complete through an interrupt system and/or a register polling mechanism. The PBCH Decoding processor would save the results in some internal registers that are accessible through the register interface. The results are mainly the MIB payload if the PBCH is decoded successfully, and an indicator whether the PBCH is decoded successfully or not.",11,Yes,STMicroelectronics,"Dr. Abdelmohsen ALI

PCIe offers significantly faster data transfer rates, improved scalability, and greater efficiency by using point-to-point architecture instead of shared parallel bus. It is widely used in modern computers for connecting graphics cards, network cards, and other high-performance hardware components.
PCIe Layering are described as follows, Transaction Layer, Data Link Layer and Physical Layer which can be divided into two sections: one that processes outbound (to be transmitted) information and one that processes inbound (received) information.
PCIe uses packets to communicate information between components.

As the transmitted packets flow through the other layers, they are extended with additional information necessary to handle packets at those layers. At the receiving side the reverse process occurs and packets get transformed from their Physical Layer representation to the Data Link Layer representation and finally (for Transaction Layer Packets) to the form that can be processed by the Transaction Layer of the receiving device.

The design of electronic chips for any application is centered around the well-known trade-off triangle: higher speed, reduced area, and lower power consumption. A key optimization strategy in achieving these objectives is minimizing the need for multiple chips by integrating as many functions as possible into a single integrated circuit, commonly known as a System-On-Chip (SoC). A typical SoC can integrate various components, such as one or more central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), embedded storage memories, interface peripherals, sensors, radio modems, phase-locked loops (PLLs), and a power management unit (PMU).
The integration of both digital and analog components onto a single chip adds significant complexity, as each component may have unique requirements and interfaces that must be carefully managed. This increases the need for specialized expertise, advanced tools, and often leads to longer development times and higher costs. Additionally, this complexity requires extensive verification throughout the digital design flow to ensure all components work together seamlessly, as a single point of failure can compromise the functionality of the entire system.

The primary objective of this project is to acquire hands-on experience in SoC integration, understand the associated challenges, apply common integration methodologies, and develop a system-level perspective of a fully functional SoC.
Although this project is primarily based on synchronous digital design and will involve a variety of block-level digital design tasks—such as developing a basic RISC-V processor, interface peripherals, digital controllers, and on-chip bus agents—the core activities and learning objectives will focus on SoC integration. Key aspects include multi-clock domain crossing techniques, clock/reset generation logic for multi-clock and multi-power domains, HW/SW interfacing through RISC-V system integration, low-power design methodologies, and behavioral modeling for interfaces with analog components.

Project Activities:
1. Reading and understanding design specifications (e.g., AMBA bus protocol, RISC-V architecture, and interface protocols).
2. Translating design specifications into synthesizable RTL code using HDL.
3. Verifying the design by running simulations with CAD tools and debugging design/integration issues.
4. Performing low-power optimization at the RTL level and writing UPF code to define power intent.
5. Implementing the design on an ASIC technology library.
Pre-requisites:
● Solid understanding of digital circuit fundamentals.
● Experience with Verilog coding and familiarity with the digital design flow.
● Basic knowledge of computer architecture and the ability to write simple C code to run on a RISC-V embedded processor.
